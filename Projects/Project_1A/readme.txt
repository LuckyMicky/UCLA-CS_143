For Project1A, I think the most challenging parts for us are:
1. Writing regex of the mathematical expression and all special error cases.
2. Understanding and using the preg_match() fucntion and eval() function properly.
3. Understanding the array of preg_match()

The links provided by the specs are helpful except that we think the Mastering regular
expression in PHP is detailed. We further searched some online regex source like
tutorialspoint. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_regular_expression.htm)

We work together to finish this lab.

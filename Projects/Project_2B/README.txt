In this project, we train the CrossValidationModel and CountVectorizerModel 
using all the labeled data. And we sampled 20% of submissions for our 
analysis. 

Extra Credit:
1. Locked vs Unlocked Submissions Sentiment
    Though few stories were locked as r/politics rarely limit discussions,
    we can check the general sentiment of posts that moderators are forced
    to intervene.
   
2. Over_18 Submissions Sentiment
    Since Over_18 posts are supposedly viewable by adults only, check what 
    type of response adults give to adult contents under over_18 flair.
